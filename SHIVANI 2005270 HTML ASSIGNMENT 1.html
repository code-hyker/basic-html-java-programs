LIFE</a></p>
<a name="TOP"><h2>Role of Motivation</h2></a>
<p>It is a strong tool that helps to get ahead in life. For being motivated we
need a driving tool or goal that keeps us motivated and moves forward. Also, it
helps in being progressive both physically and mentally. Moreover, your goal does not be to big and long term they can be small and
empowering. Furthermore, you need the right mindset to be motivated. Besides, you need to push your self towards your goal no one other than you
can push your limit. Also, you should be willing to leave your comfort zone
because your true potential is going to revel when you leave your comfort
zone.When a student is truly engrossed in a task, they have less cognitive and
emotional energy to focus on social image. Individuals who engage in
intrinsically motivating activities report that their self-consciousness and other
stressors tends to fade for the period of the activity. Motivated students are also
more able to emotionally ‘bounce back’ from a low grade on a test or a harsh
criticism from a teacher or peer. Because intrinsically motivated students are
not driven by fear of failure or criticism, they are less likely to disengage in
such circumstances. With that said, every student does feel the demotivating
effects of negative feedback, even if driven students experience them to a lesser
extent.How do we cultivate motivation?
While the above theories may differ in emphasis, each can support student
motivation through the following practical applications. Practise growth mindset :
Students who feel like they will improve through hard work will exert more
effort than those who believe that their success is based on intelligence. Teaching students to use the phrase ‘yet’ when explaining their gaps in
knowledge helps to move them away from this deterministic orientation. For
example, if a student says ‘I can’t do that’, suggest that ‘you can’t do that, yet’. Making a conscious effort to provide wait time also removes the pressure of

needing to be the first to find the answer. When students come to realise that
their teacher will always wait 5 seconds or so before calling on a student rather
than always calling on the first hand up, they will be more likely to engage with
the struggle of thinking through the problem. Finally, by keeping the emphasis
on progress rather than scores, growth mindset pushes students to continually
challenge themselves and reflect on their improvement. Even small
improvements and successes can help to spur a student’s motivation. Encourage self-efficacy :
Students who are paralysed by low academic self-confidence will struggle to
drive their own motivation. A sense of competence is enhanced through optimal
challenges. These are also referred to as ‘just right’ challenges because they are
difficult enough to be just above the student’s current ability to work
independently but easy enough for the student to follow along with the teacher. As the student practises this new skill or concept, the teacher slowly removes
their structured support, making it more and more difficult. This slow removal
of support, paired with positive reinforcement and opportunities to receive
support along the way, keeps students at this level of optimal challenge as they
improve. Consistent small successes will further enhance motivation.</p>
<a name="BOTTOM"><h2>Importance of Student Life</h2></a>
<p>Student life is the best and happiest period of life. It is a life free from all
cares and anxieties. It may be called ‘the seed time of life. If properly utilized, he can lay the foundation of future success; if misused, defeat is sure to
come.As a student has plenty of time to read books and acquire knowledge, he
should make the best use of his time to equip himself properly and be an ideal
citizen.Students take part in games and sports and take regular physical
exercise. During the student life, they acquire the virtues of honestly, loyalty, truthfulness and fellow-feeling.It is said that “student life is golden life,” because student life is the most important part of human life. It is the period of
pure joy and happiness, because the mind of a student is free from cares and
worries of a grown-up life. In this period, the character of man is built. So, it is
called the formative period of human life. Every student should try his best to
make the best use of his student life. The primary duty of a student is to learn and to acquire knowledge. He must
do all his work at the right moment and maintain punctuality and discipline. He must remember that if a student becomes successful in his student career
and his character is built on a sound basic, he will be able to shine in any
sphere of life and serve his society and countries. A student should spend most of his time of this golden period in reading and
learning. A good student never waste his time fixed for reading uselessly. But
he must not be a book-worm being always engaged in his studies. He should
also be careful about his health and spend some time daily in some sports and
games. He should try to develop his body and mind at the same time. As a student he must try to develop his intellect. He should also try to acquire
some good qualities like obedience, dutifulness, respect on elders and love and
sympathy for fellow man in the society. The duty of a student is to obey his
parents and teachers and respect the elders of the society. Students are the
future hope of country. So every student should try to be the best citizen in all
respect, so that he may serve his country as far as he can.</p><HR><BR>
